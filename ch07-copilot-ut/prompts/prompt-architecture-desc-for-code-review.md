# C4 Model Architecture Description for React + Node.js Project

Based on the package.json files provided in the codebase, I'll describe the software architecture using the C4 model's three layers: Context, Containers, and Components.

## Context Layer

The system appears to be a web application with a clear separation between frontend and backend services. The frontend is built using React with Vite, while the backend is a Node.js service using Express. The system likely provides some AI-related functionality given the OpenAI dependency in the backend.

## Containers Layer

### Frontend Container (React v18.3.1)
- A React application built with Vite (v5.4.2)
- Uses TypeScript (v5.5.3) for type safety
- Employs TailwindCSS (v3.4.1) for styling
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest (v3.1.4)
- UI components possibly enhanced with Lucide React (v0.344.0)

### Backend Container (Node.js with Express v4.18.2)
- Express-based API server
- TypeScript (v5.3.3) implementation
- Uses Inversify (v6.0.1) for dependency injection
- Integrates with OpenAI API (v4.28.0)
- Jest (v29.7.0) for testing
- Uses CORS middleware (v2.8.5) for cross-origin requests

## Components Layer

### Frontend Components
- **React Application Root**: Main entry point for the React application
- **UI Components**: Likely includes various React components using Lucide React icons
- **API Service Layer**: Components for communicating with the backend API
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Components leveraging React Testing Library (v16.3.0) for UI testing

Note: The exact component files aren't visible in the provided codebase, but would typically include:
- `src/main.tsx` or `src/index.tsx`: Entry point
- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component
- `src/components/*.tsx`: Various UI components
- `src/services/*.ts`: API service layers

### Backend Components
- **Express Server** (`src/server.ts`): Main Express application setup
- **Application Entry Point** (`src/index.ts`): Server initialization
- **API Routes**: Express route handlers for different endpoints
- **OpenAI Integration**: Services for communicating with OpenAI API
- **Dependency Injection Container**: Inversify setup for DI
- **Middleware Components**: CORS and other Express middleware

Note: The backend structure appears to include:
- `src/index.ts`: Entry point file
- `src/server.ts`: Express server configuration
- `__tests__/`: Test directory

This architecture follows a modern, decoupled approach with separate frontend and backend services, each with their own technology stacks, which allows for independent development and deployment of each container.
